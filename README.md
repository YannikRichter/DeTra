The COVID-19 Detector and Transmitter Bracelet is designed to detect possible COVID-19 outbreaks in crowded areas. In order to control the virusâ€™ spread, data can either be transmitted to medical staff or advise the bracelet carrier to consult a doctor.

The low-cost architecture of the device and its use of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) makes it ideal for areas with limited or no internet coverage.

By using different sensors, DeTra measures vital signs such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen level, which indicate infection with COVID-19 when varying from their status quo.

The real-time data transmission occurs via long-range radio waves using an integrated antenna.

Additionally, other health problems can also be monitored using DeTra, e.g. by indicating an upcoming diabetic coma of diabetes type 1 patients.
