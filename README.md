## Introduction
The COVID-19 Detector and Transmitter Bracelet is designed to detect possible COVID-19 outbreaks in crowded areas. In order to control the virusâ€™ spread, data can either be transmitted to medical staff or advise the bracelet carrier to consult a doctor.

The low-cost architecture of the device and its use of low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) makes it ideal for areas with limited or no internet coverage.

By using different sensors, DeTra measures vital signs such as heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen level, which indicate infection with COVID-19 when varying from their status quo.

The real-time data transmission occurs via long-range radio waves using an integrated antenna.

Additionally, other health problems can also be monitored using DeTra, e.g. by indicating an upcoming diabetic coma of diabetes type 1 patients.

## Operation of DeTra
DeTra is characterized by its user-friendly operation and its long battery life. DeTra is charged via Micro-USB. If DeTra is not used it falls into deep sleep mode. To collect data DeTra wakes up every 3 hours and measures the corresponding vital parameters. For entering the menu, one of the two touch pins on the front of DeTra needs to be pressed, which automatically wakes up the device.

Within the menu, the left touch pin is used to move the cursor up and the right touch pin is used to move the cursor down. When reaching the parameter to be measured, it will be selected automatically after a defined amount of time. To stop the measurement both pins need to be touched simultaneously and DeTra returns to deep sleep mode.
